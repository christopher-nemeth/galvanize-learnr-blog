# Galvanize Learnr

This Galvanize project required students to create a blog site that utilizes semantic HTML and CSS best practices. The purpose of the blog site is to explain our experience with the Learn to Learn method in our studies and networking. You can visit the site by clicking on the deployed link [here](https://galv-learnr-blog.firebaseapp.com/index.html). This project did not require a responsive version, however, I used some media queries to give it a web application "feel." Please resize your browser or view the deployed link on your mobile device. Below were the requirements for the project.

### Website Requirements

* Well-formatted HTML and CSS
* [Deployed](https://galv-learnr-blog.firebaseapp.com/index.html)
* Good visual hierarchy, color selection, typography
    * Feel free to be "inspired by" (rip off) popular layouts if you are nervous about this

### Content Requirements

Reuse/repurpose content from your previous drills for this site.
