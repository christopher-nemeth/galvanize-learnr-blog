                    <p>Welcome to my learn to learn blog site! My name is Christopher Nemeth. I am a web developer based
                        out of beautiful Denver, CO. During my free time I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, cooking,
                        sampling the local brews, and internet surfing. My initial interest in web development happened
                        many years ago when livejournal.com was "the thing", and I had learned that you could implement
                        different styled layouts and then customize them deeper in the actual html. It wasn't until the
                        summer of 2017 that my friend suggested I should get into programming, so I tried out
                        CodeAcademy, and knew I wanted to make a career shift. Since then I was fortunate to be apart of
                        Galvanizes Web Development Immersive program to embark on this new journey. One of the biggest
                        takeaways I learned at Galvanize is learning like a programmer. "Learn to learn" is a modern set
                        of techniques and guidelines for how developers should structure there time learning new and
                        difficult concepts. The three main concepts to Learn to Learn are:</p>
                    <ol class="about-list">
                        <li>1. Set the Stage</li>
                        <li>2. Play</li>
                        <li>3. Reflect</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>By setting the stage, you in essence want to clear your palette for the day by closing out tabs/browsers
                with distracting websites, mute any unimportant notifications, set a break timer, and set some short
                term goals for what you want to achieve.</p>
            <p>The idea of play is an excellent method to learn new things by "wrestling" with what you're learning. Try
                it out. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. This will help immensely when trying new things especially
                new languages.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, you want to take the time to reflect at the end of the day to evaluate how your
                learning process went, what could be better, and what you took away as a win. Self reflections is not
                just an important learning skill, but in general a great life skill.</p>
            <p>Lastly, some other great considerations to learning to learn are setting measurable and achievable goals.
                This will help you manage the allotted time you have dedicated to learning for the day. Also, supporting
                your local tech community by attending meetups is a great way to network and keep up to date with
                emerging and new developments in technology.</p>
