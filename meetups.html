            <h1>Meet Ups</h1>
            <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
            <p>February Develop Happy Hour @ Solutions Lounge &amp; Restaurant 2220 California St, Denver, CO</p>
            <h2>People I Met</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rachel Doren works as a full stack developer for SpotX and she is currently working an application
                    that exchanges data to the engineers to help better communicate with them.</li>
                <li>Alexander Seplowe works as a full stack developer for Levels Beyond. He develops content management
                    software for audio and video.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this meet up. It was nerve racking at first talking to new people, which is usually
                something that I don’t have too much of a hard time with. It was also great to see Stefan Kowal, a
                former teacher’s assistant at GA that helped teach the part time front end course I took a year ago, and
                I approached him and asked if he would meet some of the g77 crew. He immediately accepted and I was able
                to introduce him to a bunch of folks, which was great. I learned that when everyone is in the room to
                network, it helps break the ice mentally, and I look forward to taking this information with me to the
                next meet up. I also received some exceptional advice from Alex who recommended to not be afraid to try
                and tackle hard problems and to keep learning as much as I can. Overall, it was an A+ experience and I
                look forward to attending the next dev happy hour.
            </p>
            <h2>Takeaway Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>1. What basic questions can I ask to everyone I meet that will provide me with the most information?
                    (I had a hard time thinking of new questions to ask people who are more mid/senior level. Perhaps it
                    was nervousness of being the noob.)</li>
                <li>2. How to break the ice better?</li>
                <li>3. How can I improve feeling confident as a noob when talking with people who are mid/senior level?
                </li>

            <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
            <p>React Denver @ Turing School of Software and Design. 2-20-18.</p>
            <h2>People I Met</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Gabriel Konkel who is a front end developer who has a small consulting company with his brother who
                    does the back end work.</li>
                <li>Gabriel Camargo who works for Ingenious and manages developers. Currently working on ReasonML.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>I learned that Konkel used GatsbyJS to work on a website for mikejohnsonforcolorado.com and some of the
                things GatsbyJS can do. While some of the things he said were over my head, one take away that I liked
                was that it allows your site to load its pages behind the scenes so it doesn't disrupt the user
                experience while making the site faster when navigating between pages. Additionally, I learned that
                Camargo is currently working on improving ReasonML which is new syntax for an old language called Ocaml
                AST. Again a lot of the information was over my head, but it was interesting how you can implement new
                syntax to old languages.</p>
            <h2>Takeaway Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>1. Some of the take away questions I have were just more general questions regarding how JS,and
                    these other frameworks talk with the back end and the benefits for implementing ReasonML into JS to
                    change the typecasting of arguments, instead of using a different language all together.</li>
                <li>2. Which frameworks and languages should I focus on once I progress farther with vanilla JS.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
            <p>Monthly DenverScript Meetup @ Code Talent - 3412 Blake Street</p>
            <h2>People I Met</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Jim Tomonto - Founder and Architect for JT Solutions</li>
                <li>Drew Dahlman - Interactive Art Director / Developer for Legwork</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>I was lucky to catch Jim before he left for the web app security meetup down the road. He was talking to
                Sean and I about his opinions regarding different front end libraries and some of there benefits. He
                also helped explain blockchain since that what he has been currently working on. I still didn't
                understand the full scope regarding how people are able to mine the crypto currency, but he
                unfortunately had to leave to go to the other meetup. I also had a chance to learn about Docker from
                Drew, and why being able to install dependencies (Gems, Node Modules, etc) to docker on a different
                machine is better than having to install them on your machine locally. If you have an OS update it could
                break everything, hence why you would want to install the dependencies on a different machine. A lot of
                it was slightly out of reach because there were a lot of CLI stuff I'm not familiar with, work flows,
                etc. </p>
            <h2>Takeaway Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>1. How does blockchain work on a simpler scale?</li>
                <li>2. What are programming workflows in regards to the command line?</li>
                <li>3. How does Docker work in regards to working on another machine remotely? It sounded like hacking
                </li>
