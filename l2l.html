            <h1>Learn to Learn Techniques</h1>
            <h2>Set the Stage</h2>
            <p>To set today’s stage I closed all of my distracting tabs (Reddit is the devil), turned off notifications,
                changed locations to work, put some headphones on to drown out some of the ambient noise, and opened a
                new terminal window. My main objectives today are to study JS terminology and start working on the
                practice work for drill 1 and get over this temporary road block.</p>
            <h2>Play</h2>
            <p>I was able to play around on repl.it for a bit to go along with my reading material because I enjoy
                learning by doing. I started tackling the the practice for the first JS drill and was having a little
                trouble applying it all together. I wasn’t writing my reset function to empty an array correctly so I
                had to take a break
                from it for a few minutes.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I feel like I was able to learn a little bit today by reading up on more JS syntax. I didn’t get to
                finish the practice drill, but I won’t let that discourage me. I am waiting for my light-bulb moment,
                and I feel like it is close. I am looking forward to reading and studying on MDN, and Jon Duckett’s
                Javascript book this weekend and then spend President’s Day on campus to continue working hard. By
                starting with a fresh, palette and turning off my notifications, I was able to learn more effectively
                without disruptions or distractions.</p>
