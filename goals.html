                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>It was great coming in on the holiday because it was quiet and a great opportunity for some focused learning. By setting  the stage and focusing on these goals for first thing this morning, I was able to feel good about what I wanted to get accomplished today. For my second goal, I learned that the dot method is our friend when calling key value pairs in our arrays inside of objects. With this thought in my mind, I went to lunch to let it simmer until I could get back and wrestle with the JS drill. When I came back from lunch, I fired up the first JS drill and was able to get the first test running after a little while. I did however get distracted during this process because I was also trying to read up and watch some videos on loops since the second test sounded like it was going to need them in order to pass. I ended up getting stuck on the second test, and although I didn't accomplish goal 3, I took getting the first test to pass as a win. Tonight after I have some dinner, I am going to do some light learning by watching some of our JS breakouts, and continue doing so tomorrow. Tomorrow will require some more focused learning and I'm thinking it will be better if I can find a quieter place to do so.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>1. Read up on for loops for the first half of the morning to better conceptualize them within functions.</li>
                    <li>2. Complete JS drill 1 by end of day.</li>
                    <li>3. Learn about wire framing software that I could use to help wire fram bucket 1 project.</li>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Today was excellent for the most part. I was able to set the stage right away and prep what I wanted to get accomplished in a timely manner. I started looking at JS loop concepts just to refresh my memory, I felt pretty good about it so I jumped right into where I left off with JS drill 1. I got my double for loops down for the second test, but started to struggle as far as using the loop information properly. I appreciate Coleman for recognizing my struggle and helped me solve the drill by having me talk through the logic, which heleped me learn more effectively rather than just giving me the answer. I was able to complete the drill sooner than expected and took lunch. Once I got back from lunch I attended the functions breakout and came out of it feeling like a boss, so since I was ahead of schedule with my daily goals I dove right into the 2nd JS drill. I was able to get to the 2nd test but ended up getting stuck on the loops portion again. I ended up spending too much time feeling stuck, so I walked away from it and helped Allison with condensing some of her repeating css code and some alignment stuff that she was frustrated about. Overall, I didn't feel like I got derailed too much and my 2 wins for the day were getting JS drill 1 down, and helping a classmate. Tomorrow I am looking forawrd to finishing the JS drill 2 and starting to wire frame my bucket 1 project.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>1. Finish up some soft skills by the first breakout.</li>
                    <li>2. Collaborate with classmates who are also working on the same JS content and talk through the logic for better understanding breakouts.</li>
                    <li>3. Comeplete JS drill 2 by end of day.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>After courage time I jumped right into some soft skill reflections from the day prior. My commitment was to have these completed by noon. I was successful in doing so which was a great feeling even while I had taken a break to try and do a breakout with Brooks via slack video. After lunch I met up with Sean and Vincy to have a mini study group to talk through some of the JS logic and fundamentals. I was a little hung up on finishing the second test in JS drill 2 so I attended the meet ups with Matt in the afternoon on accessing objects, array access and manipulation. I understood the content of the breakouts and was able to contribute to what was going on which was nice, but I wish I had broken off earlier to conitunue working on the drills. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish up JS drill 2 because the breakouts consumed the remainder of the afternoon, but my plan is to jump right back on the horse and reach out for help tomorrow.</p>
